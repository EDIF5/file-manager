# file-manager
Our project stresses on file management on the mobile phone.
We know that there are many options for the android operating system users to manage their file. 
but, there could be some draw backs of many of them. In our project we have the mark of doing the following operations.
1)make file undeletable or autorized file deletion. It is used for security of the user's file.
2)duplicate file deletion. Helps for performance and storage optimization, and also for minimizing. file complexity.
3)file encryption and decryption, also for security purpose.
4)assembling preferred file types under one folder.
